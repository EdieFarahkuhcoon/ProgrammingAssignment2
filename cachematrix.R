## Functions create a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. 
## First, we compute the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated, then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
